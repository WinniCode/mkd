Cover with a plate seal ensuring each well is sealed separately from the next, vortex 15 seconds. Spin down briefly at 3000rpm and ensure there are no trapped air bubbles in the wells. This is really important -- if there are bubbles just tap plate to make sure all air bubbles are removed.</p> <p>5.4.6.7 For best results run the plate immediately. If the plate will not be used immediately cover the sample plate with foil and store at 4\u00baC (The intercalating dye should stabilise your sample but the plate must be run within the same day). Spin the plate again (3000rpm) before use and be sure to remove the cover film before placing the plate in the instrument.</p> <p>5.4.6.8 Ensure all contaminated plastics from the RNA assays are disposed of in the purple lidded waste container and all liquid waste is placed in the labelled waste bottle.</p> <p>5.4.7 Running an Experiment</p> <p>5.4.7.1.

Step1 flushes the capillary array with 0.5 M NaOH; Step 2 rinses the capillary array with water. It is important to run Step 2 immediately after Step 1 to avoid corrosion of the capillary array. Step 2 is drawing the water to rinse from the same position where the NaOH solution for Step 1 is. For this reason, Step 1 and Step 2 cannot be queued up. First, run Step 1 and wait for it to finish.
